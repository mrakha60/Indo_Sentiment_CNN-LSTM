# Indo_Sentiment_CNN-LSTM
This repository contains the code and resources for sentiment analysis of reviews for the IKD (Digital Population Identity) application on Google Playstore using a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and classify the sentiment of user reviews for the IKD application. By leveraging a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the project aims to accurately capture the nuances in user sentiment expressed in their reviews.

Featuring:
- Data Collection: Crawling and preprocessing of review data from Google Playstore.
- Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, and padding of review data.
- Model Implementation: Building and training a CNN-LSTM model for sentiment classification.
- Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using various metrics.
- Visualization: Visualizing the results and insights from the sentiment analysis.
